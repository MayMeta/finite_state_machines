# Finite-State Machines

This framework provides a pure-Python implementation of
[Finite-State Machines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite-state_machine) -
simple and useful graph-like computational models.

Main code file can be found here: [fsm.py](finite_state_machines/fsm.py)  
A toy problem definition can be found here: [ToyProblem.md](examples/ToyProblem.md)
